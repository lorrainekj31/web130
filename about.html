		<p>I am a web design student at Seattle Central College. I plan to finish my course load in the Fall quarter of 2014 (I hope).</p>
		<p>I have spent most of my worklife in hand assembly and shipping and recieving in several printing companies.</p>
		<p>Prior to this program, I have had no design or coding experience so the whole field is quite new to me. I have plenty of experienc as a web user, but not a web author. I have enjoyed learning so much. I particularly like CSS since it's the closest I have come to anything artistic.</p>
